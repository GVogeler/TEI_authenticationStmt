      <p>Release 4.6.0 is codenamed <q>The Peace Release</q>.</p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestone/14?closed=1">4.6.0 milestone</ref>.</p>
      <p>The <q>Peace Release</q> delivers a new Roma v1.0.0, available at <ref
          target="https://roma.tei-c.org/">https://roma.tei-c.org/</ref>. TEI Roma now has a
        localized user interface for EN, ES, DE, FR, IT, and JA languages, with thanks to
        translators listed on the home page. The original Roma remains available at <ref
          target="http://romaantiqua.tei-c.org/">http://romaantiqua.tei-c.org/</ref>. </p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>

          <head>New encoding features</head>

          <item>The <gi>calendar</gi> element is now a member of <ident type="class"
              >att.typed</ident>, permitting <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2396">#2396</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>lg</gi> element may now contain any of the members of <ident type="class"
              >model.pPart.transcriptional</ident>, including <gi>supplied</gi>, <gi>redo</gi>, and
              <gi>damage</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2242"
            >#2242</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <att>gender</att> attribute has been added to the elements in <ident
              type="class">model.castItem.part</ident> and the <att>sex</att> attribute to the
              <gi>actor</gi> element so that these are available for encoding cast lists in
            performance texts (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2400"
            >#2400</ref>).</item>
          <item><gi>vColl</gi> elements may now self-nest, so that the TEI specifications match the
            Guidelines prose (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2034"
            >2034</ref>).</item>
        </list>
        <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>In the next 4.7.0 release Council will be altering to the content model of the
              <gi>content</gi> element to permit it one and only one child element (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2381">#2381</ref>). The current 4.6.0
            release issues a Schematron deprecation warning about the upcoming change for ODD
            writers (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2410">PR #2410</ref>). </item>

          <!-- 2023-04-04 ebb: Should we say anything about the last stage of the altIdent series being implemented? (Just the removal of the deprecation?)
            Or, what needs to be said of altIdent? See https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2334 
           -->
        </list>
        <list>
          <head>Improvements of prose and examples</head>

          <item>The <gi>biblStruct</gi> element now has a new example featuring the use of a
              <att>type</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1773"
              >#1773</ref>).</item>

          <item>An outdated link in an example in <ident type="class">att.global</ident> was updated
            with a new example from a current archive, and the Bibliography was updated to reflect
            the change (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2366">#2366</ref>). Another
            misrepresented source for an example in the Manuscript Description chapter was corrected
              (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2372">#2372</ref>).</item>

          <item>To improve consistency, many <gi>desc</gi> elements were converted to <gi>gloss</gi>
            elements and vice versa, and underscores were removed from glosses in several element
            specifications (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2388">PR
            #2388</ref>).</item>


          <item>The explanation of the attribute <att>ns</att> has been clarified in <ident
              type="class">att.namespaceable</ident> to indicate more precisely that it refers to an
            element being defined (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2395"
            >#2395</ref>).</item>

              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2251">#2251</ref>) </item>

          <item>The <att>ref</att> attributes on <gi>title</gi> elements in the Guidelines have been
            replaced with <gi>ref</gi> elements with <att>target</att> attributes to ensure their
            values are properly processed as links (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2368">#2368</ref>).</item>
        </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref
