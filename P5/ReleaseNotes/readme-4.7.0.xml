      <p>Release 4.7.0 is codenamed <q>????</q>.</p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
        <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestone/15?closed=1">4.7.0 milestone</ref>.</p>
      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release:
      <list>
	<head>New encoding features</head>
        <item>New with this release is the <gi>eventName</gi> element,
	which may be used to encode names of events either in
	general transcribed text, or particularly in the
	<gi>event</gi> element. (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2382">#2382</ref>).</item>
        <item>The content model of <gi>event</gi> has been modified to
        allow <gi>eventName</gi> (but it still allows older ways of
        labeling events). See <ref
        target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2483">PR #2483</ref>.
        </item>
        <item>A Schematron constraint has been added to the
        specification for <gi>dataSpec</gi> in order to prevent the
        possibility of elements being included in the specification
        for an attributeâ€™s datatype (<ref
        target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2443">PR #2443</ref>
        and <ref
        target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2426">#2426</ref>).</item>
      </list>
      <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>A <att>scheme</att> attribute is now usually optional on <gi>constraintSpec</gi>, except for the case of a <gi>constraintSpec</gi> with <att>mode</att> = "add" or <att>mode</att> = "replace" (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2453">PR #2453</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2261">#2261</ref>). </item>
      <!--    <item>It is anticipated that in a future release the content model of the
              <gi>content</gi> element will require that it have one and only one child element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2381">#2381</ref>). Thus a Schematron
	      warning for ODD
              writers  about this upcoming change has been added to
	      this release  (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2410">PR #2410</ref>). </item>-->

	  <item></item>
	 <!-- <item>The <name type="class">model.glossLike</name> class
	  (which contained <gi>altIdent</gi>, <gi>equiv</gi>, and <gi>gloss</gi>)
	  has been renamed to <name type="class">model.identSynonyms</name>.</item>-->
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>With these release notes we are beginning a practice of documenting changes to content models that could invalidate ODD customizations in TEI projects 
        if they are working with the current release of these TEI Guidelines. Those maintaining ODD customizations of the TEI may want to be aware of the following changes and 
        adapt your ODD files accordingly.

        <!--  <item>The TEI oXygen framework has been updated to
 	    accommodate the fact that versions 25+ of oXygen use Saxon 11 (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2251">#2251</ref>) </item>

            <item>The <gi>title</gi> elements with <att>ref</att>
            attributes used to refer from the Guidelines to some
            external standards have been replaced with <gi>ref</gi>
            elements with <att>target</att> attributes both for
            internal consistency of encoding and to ensure their
            values are properly processed as links (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2368">#2368</ref>).</item>-->

        </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
        <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/milestone/14?closed=1">7.56.0 milestone</ref>.</p>
