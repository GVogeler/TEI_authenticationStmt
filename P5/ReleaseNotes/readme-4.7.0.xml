      <p>Release 4.7.0 is codenamed <q>????</q>.</p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
        <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestone/15?closed=1">4.7.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>

          <head>New encoding features</head>
        <item>New with this release is the <gi>eventName</gi> element, which may be used anywhere as a member of <name type="class">att.global</name> to encode a name for an event. 
          The new <gi>eventName</gi> element also has membership in several attribute classes associated with named entities, including <name type="class">att.datable</name> to supply a date range for the use of an event's name, and <name type="class">att.typed</name>, allowing it <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes. It has also been added to <name type="class">att.editLike</name>, permitting its application in contexts of describing events in an editing process (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2382">#2382</ref>).</item>
        <item>The content model of <gi>event</gi> has been modified to contain <gi>eventName</gi> elements without invalidate older ways of labeling events.
          The first child of an <gi>event</gi> element may still be an <gi>idno</gi> a <gi>head</gi> element, but modelling of events may now begin instead with <gi>eventName</gi> or with members of <name type="class">model.pLike</name> (<gi>ab</gi> or <gi>p</gi>) or <name type="class">model.labelLike</name> (<gi>desc</gi> or <gi>label</gi>). See <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2483">PR #2483</ref>.
        </item>
        <item>A Schematron constraint has been added to the specification for <gi>dataSpec</gi> in order to prevent the possibility of elements being included in the specification for an attributeâ€™s datatype (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2443">PR #2443</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2426">#2426</ref>).</item>
        <item></item>
          
   
             
        </list>
        <list>
          <head>Deprecations</head>
          <item>The <gi>re</gi> element in the dictionaries module is now deprecated, since its model and use are identical to <gi>entry</gi> with <att>type</att> = "related" <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2456">#2456</ref>.</item>
          
        </list>

        <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>At the request of the Manuscript SIG, the content model of <gi>additional</gi> is now more flexible, permitting any alternation of <name type="class">model.pLike</name> (<gi>p</gi> or <gi>ab</gi>) with zero or more of <gi>adminInfo</gi>, <gi>surrogates</gi>, or <gi>listBibl</gi> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2195">#2195</ref>).</item>
          <item>The content model of <gi>revisionDesc</gi> now permits multiple <gi>listChange</gi> elements (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2420">#2420</ref>).</item>
          <item>A <att>scheme</att> attribute is now usually optional on <gi>constraintSpec</gi>, except for the case of a <gi>constraintSpec</gi> with <att>mode</att> = "add" or <att>mode</att> = "replace" (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2453">PR #2453</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2261">#2261</ref>). </item>
          <item>The datatype of the <att>class</att> attribute on <gi>attRef</gi> has been changed from teidata.word to teidata.name (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2276">#2276</ref>).</item>

	 <!-- <item>The <name type="class">model.glossLike</name> class

      <p>With these release notes we are beginning a practice of documenting changes to content models that could invalidate ODD customizations in TEI projects 
        if they are working with the current release of these TEI Guidelines. Those maintaining ODD customizations of the TEI may want to be aware of the following changes and 
        adapt your ODD files accordingly.

          <item>Several Japanese translations have been added to element, attribute, and class specifications (PRs <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2448">#2448</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2449">#2449</ref>, and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2461">#2461</ref>).</item>

            <item>The <gi>title</gi> elements with <att>ref</att>
            attributes used to refer from the Guidelines to some
            external standards have been replaced with <gi>ref</gi>
            elements with <att>target</att> attributes both for
            internal consistency of encoding and to ensure their
            values are properly processed as links (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2368">#2368</ref>).</item>-->

        </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
