      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: 
        <list>
          <head>New encoding features</head>
          <item>A new <gi>constraintDecl</gi> element provides a way for TEI ODDs to specify their
            Schematron query language binding (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2330">#2330</ref>, 
            <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2594">PR #2594</ref>, and

        </list>
        <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>With this release, <gi>bibl</gi>, <gi>biblFull</gi>, and <gi>biblStruct</gi> are now members of <name type="class">att.canonical</name>, 
            permitting the <att>ref</att> attribute on these elements. Examples and explanation have been added to the Core Elements chapter 
            to clarify when it is best to use the attributes <att>ref</att> vs. <att>key</att> on these elements 
            (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2392">#2392</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2655">PR #2655</ref>).</item>
          <item>In response to several different requests from the community, the <att>place</att> attribute is now available on 
            <gi>div</gi>, <gi>postscript</gi>, <gi>sp</gi>, and <gi>speaker</gi> for use in describing where these appear in the source document. 
            Additionally, the attribute class <name type="class">att.placement</name> has been added to <name type="class">att.transcriptional</name>, 
            making the <att>place</att> attribute more widely available on <gi>del</gi>, <gi>delSpan</gi>, <gi>mod</gi>, <gi>redo</gi>, <gi>restore</gi>,
            <gi>retrace</gi>, <gi>subst</gi>, <gi>substJoin</gi>, and <gi>undo</gi>. See (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2528">#2528</ref>,

            <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2665">PR #2665</ref>).
          </item>
          <item>The <att>hand</att> attribute is now available on <gi>emph</gi> and <gi>dateline</gi> 
            (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2550">#2550</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2587">PR #2587</ref>, 
            and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2644">PR #2644</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>language</gi> element within <gi>profileDesc</gi> may now have a <att>scope</att> attribute 
            to indicate how much a language is used in the document (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2516">#2516</ref> 
            and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2631">PR #2631</ref>).</item>
          <item>The datatype of the <att>reason</att> attribute is now defined consistently as <name type="datatype">teidata.enumerated</name> on each of these elements:
            <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>secl</gi>, <gi>supplied</gi>, and <gi>surplus</gi> 
            (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2580">#2580</ref> and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2581">PR #2581</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>xenoData</gi> element now permits more than one child element, when previously it was allowed only one 
            (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2584">PR #2584</ref>).</item>
          <item><gi>elementRef</gi> is now constrained to prevent duplication in an ODD schema specification and to prevent the use of <att>source</att>, 
            since an element reference in a content model must be locally defined (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2543">#2543</ref> 
            and <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2552">PR 2552</ref>).</item>
        </list>
        <list>
          <head>Changes to classes</head>
          <item>The <name type="class">att.transcriptional</name> class now includes <name type="class">att.placement</name> 
            (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2665">PR #2665</ref>).</item>
      
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>The following changes introduced with this release could invalidate ODD customizations in
        TEI projects. Those maintaining ODD customizations of the TEI should be aware of the
        following changes, and may need to adapt their ODD files accordingly. <list>
          <head>ODD-breaking changes and deprecation</head>
          <item>Due to the addition of <name type="class">att.placement</name> to <name type="class">att.transcriptional</name>, 
            an ODD customization that attempts to remove the class <name type="class">att.placement</name> from the elements
            <gi>add</gi>, <gi>addSpan</gi>, and <gi>rt</gi> may not work to remove the <att>place</att> attribute in this version of the Guidelines.
            The ODD customizer seeking to remove <att>place</att> from these elements is advised to remove the attribute rather than the class.</item>
          <item>Following a deprecation period that has now ended, the <att>calendar</att> attribute has been
          removed from <name type="class">att.datable</name> elements in the TEI Lite, Tite, and JTEI ODD files 
            maintained by the TEI (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2615">PR #2615</ref>).</item>
