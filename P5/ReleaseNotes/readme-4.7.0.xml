      <p>Release 4.7.0 is codenamed <q>????</q>.</p>
      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of
        feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
        <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestone/15?closed=1">4.7.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>

          <head>New encoding features</head>
        <item>New with this release is the <gi>eventName</gi> element, which may be used anywhere as a member of <name type="class">att.global</name> to encode a name for an event. 
          The new <gi>eventName</gi> element also has membership in several attribute classes associated with named entities, including <name type="class">att.datable</name> to supply a date range for the use of an event's name, and <name type="class">att.typed</name>, allowing it <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes. It has also been added to <name type="class">att.editLike</name>, permitting its application in contexts of describing events in an editing process (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2382">#2382</ref>).</item>
        <item>The content model of <gi>event</gi> has been modified to contain <gi>eventName</gi> elements without invalidate older ways of labeling events.
          The first child of an <gi>event</gi> element may still be an <gi>idno</gi> a <gi>head</gi> element, but modelling of events may now begin instead with <gi>eventName</gi> or with members of <name type="model">model.pLike</name> (<gi>ab</gi> or <gi>p</gi>) or <name type="model">model.labelLike</name> (<gi>desc</gi> or <gi>label</gi>). See <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2483">PR #2483</ref>.

        <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item></item>
      <!--    <item>It is anticipated that in a future release the content model of the
              <gi>content</gi> element will require that it have one and only one child element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2381">#2381</ref>). Thus a Schematron
	      warning for ODD
              writers  about this upcoming change has been added to
	      this release  (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2410">PR #2410</ref>). </item>-->

          <head>Changes to classes</head>
	  <item></item>
	 <!-- <item>The <name type="class">model.glossLike</name> class
	  (which contained <gi>altIdent</gi>, <gi>equiv</gi>, and <gi>gloss</gi>)
	  has been renamed to <name type="class">model.identSynonyms</name>.</item>-->
        </list>
      </p>
      <p>With these release notes we are beginning a practice of documenting changes to content models that could invalidate ODD customizations in TEI projects 
        if they are working with the current release of these TEI Guidelines. Those maintaining ODD customizations of the TEI may want to be aware of the following changes and 
        adapt your ODD files accordingly.

          <head>Improvements of prose and examples</head>
          <item></item>

         <!-- <item>The <gi>biblStruct</gi> element now has a new example featuring the use of a
              <att>type</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1773">#1773</ref>).</item>

          <item>An outdated link in an example in <name type="class">att.global</name> was updated
            with a new example from a current archive, and the Bibliography was updated to reflect
            the change (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2366">#2366</ref>).</item>

          <item>A misrepresented source for an example in the
            Manuscript Description chapter was corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2372">#2372</ref>).</item>

          <item>To improve consistency, many <gi>desc</gi> elements were converted to <gi>gloss</gi>
            elements and vice versa, and underscores were removed from glosses in several element
            specifications (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2388">PR
            #2388</ref>).</item>

          <item>The explanation of the attribute <att>ns</att> has been clarified in <name type="class">att.namespaceable</name> to indicate more precisely that it refers to an
            element being defined (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2395">#2395</ref>).</item>

          <item>In addition, several typos, unclear expressions, and faulty encodings have been
            corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2252">#2252</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2403">#2403</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2387">#2387</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2225">#2225</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2375">PR #2375</ref>, <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2356">#2356</ref>).</item>

            internal consistency of encoding and to ensure their

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A

      <p>Highlights of this release include:<list>
        
        <item></item>

   <!--   <item>Information about attributes assigned to an attribute
      class via an <gi>attRef</gi> that refers to another attribute
      class (as opposed to class membership via <gi>memberOf</gi> or
      attribute definition via <gi>attDef</gi>) was not showing up in
      the documentation specification pages; this has been fixed (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/419">#419</ref>).</item>

          <item>Infelicitous spacing in <gi>egXML</gi> was corrected with resetting the HTML output
            declaration to prevent indentation (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/pull/599">PR #599</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrected a problem with processing the
          <att>minOccurs</att> attribute on <gi>attDef</gi> — when set
          to <val>0</val> <att>minOccurs</att> was behaving as if
          it had been set to <val>1</val> unless <att>maxOccurs</att>
          was <val>unbounded</val> (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/557">#557</ref>).</item>

          <item>Cases of an <gi>attDef</gi> with a <att>mode</att> of
          <val>delete</val> that was inside an <gi>attList</gi> that
          was itself inside an <gi>attList</gi> were not being
          processed; this was corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/pull/601">PR
          #601</ref>).</item>

          <item>In processing ODDs, the contents of <gi>code</gi>
	  elements within <gi>desc</gi> were being dropped from the
	  RELAX NG output; this was corrected (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/pull/514">PR #514</ref>).</item>

          <item>Improved the documentation of the <code>$cssInlineFiles</code> parameter (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/538">#538</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrected serious problems in <name type="file">Test/test.odd</name> with invalid
            and undocumented values of the <att>atts</att> attribute (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/329">#329</ref>).</item>

          <item>Corrected a problem in the OxGarage conversion of XLSX spreadsheets to TEI in which
            empty cells were being omitted (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/323">#323</ref>).</item>-->
