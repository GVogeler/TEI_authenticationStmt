      </p>

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide

          <ref target="http://oxgarage.tei-c.org/">OxGarage</ref> as well as other TEI conversions).
        The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref
          target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
        full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the
          <ref
          target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+7.54.0%22+is%3Aclosed"
          >7.54.0 milestone</ref>.</p>

      <p>Highlights of this release include:<list>

          <item>The content attributes in <name type="file">odds/odd2odd.xsl</name> have been copied
            over in order to retain attributes like <att>preserveOrder</att> declared on the source
            element (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/241"
            >#241</ref>).</item>

          <item>An XSLT template has been added to <name type="file">common/common_core.xsl</name>
            that prevents the content of the <gi>index</gi> element within the <gi>head</gi> element
            from being displayed in the table of contents (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/382">#382</ref>).</item>

          <item>A warning has been added to <name type="file">epub/epub_common.xsl</name> in case the id
            the <att>facs</att> attribute refers to does not exist (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/476">#476</ref>).</item>

          <item>A bug in the processing of <gi>constraintSpec</gi> was fixed in <name type="file"
              >odds/odd2odd.xsl</name> by changing the keys of the <gi>constraintSpec</gi> element to
            use the <att>ident</att> attribute only and by processing all descendant
              <gi>constraintSpec</gi> elements (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/541">#541</ref>).</item>

          <item>The attribute <code>classpathref="classpath"</code> has been added to <name
              type="file">common/teianttasks.xml</name> to allow the TEI Stylesheets to be called
            from external scripts that will submit the classpath location (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/544">#544</ref>).</item>

          <item>The whitespace differences that have caused errors in RNC when running the tests
            were prevented by adding -bBw switches on the diff commands <ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/560">#560</ref>.</item>

          <item>The issue with un-escaped hashes when transforming teitolatex has been fixed by
            applying the text template and its tei:escapeChars function to the computed link text of
            pointers which are processed in the <val>xref</val> mode (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/565">#565</ref>).</item>

          <item>The examples of the show-all-examples pages have been appended with an indication
            that the user is about to go into a different language version of the Guidelines <ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues/571">#571</ref>.</item>
